# SQL
* "--select " to comment a line
- "/*select .. */"  to comment multiple lines
## DQL
* avoid to use window function `over (partition by order by)` because the cost is so expensive as db have to scan all rows
### basic command
1. use "in" in where clause
```
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE department IN ("Marketing", "IT");

--not
--1
select * FROM customers 
where not(country = 'france');
--2
select * FROM customers 
where country not in ( 'France', 'Brazil', 'USA' );
```
2. basic agg function
```
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(milliseconds), 2) avg_mill, 
    SUM(milliseconds) sum_mill, 
    MIN(milliseconds) min_mill, 
    MAX(milliseconds) AS max_mill, 
    COUNT(milliseconds) count_mill 
FROM tracks;
```
3. random number and limit/offset
```
--show only first n row
SELECT name, random()
FROM tracks
order by random() DESC limit n 

--show after first n row
SELECT name, random()
FROM tracks
order by random() DESC offset n 
```
4. check a type of rows
```
--sql 
select typeof(column) from table

--postgresql
select pg_typeof(column) from table
``` 
### work with string
1. create a new column from another one
```
SELECT
    name,
    LOWER(name) || "@company.com" as company_email
FROM employee;
```
2. `substring` to split string 
```
SELECT SUBSTRING ('COMPSCI101', 1, 7);
```
3. find string with regular expression
```
--postgresql use ~ or !~ 
select *
from Patients
where conditions ~ '^(.*\s)?DIAB1' 

--glob
select FirstName, Country from customers
where upper(country) glob '[UB]*'; 

--regexp
select FirstName, Country from customers
where upper(country) regexp '^[UB]';
```
4. find specific text using `like`
```
--1 % = anything
select FirstName, LastName, Country, Email FROM customers 
where Email like "%hotmail.com";
--1.1 start with, end with
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'b%s';
--2 _ = anything but only character
select FirstName, LastName, Country, Email FROM customers 
where FirstName like "M_rc";
--2.1 find the second character
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%';
--2.2 find string start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';
```
5. use `string_agg()` to merge all text in to on row
```
--postgresql
select sell_date, count(distinct product) as num_sold, string_agg(distinct product, ',') as products
from Activities
group by sell_date
order by 2 desc
```
6. use `char_length` to filter a number of letters
```
select tweet_id
from Tweets
where char_length(content) > 15
```
### about date
1. extract specific format from datetime  
```
--sqlite strftime() and cast() to change datatype
SELECT
    invoicedate,
    CAST(STRFTIME('%Y', invoicedate) AS INT) AS year,
    STRFTIME('%m', invoicedate) AS month,
    STRFTIME('%d', invoicedate) AS day,
    strftime('%Y-%M', INVOICEDATE) AS MONTHID
FROM invoices
WHERE YEAR = 2010;

--mysql date_format()
select 
    DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, "%Y-%m") as month ,
from Transactions
where DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, "%Y-%m") = "2018-12"

--SQL Server datepart()
SELECT DATEPART(year, '2017/08/25') AS DatePartInt;

--MySQL extract()
SELECT EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM "2017-06-15 09:34:21");
```
2. use `data_add()` to add/reduce date
```
--mysql
SELECT W1.id
FROM Weather W1
JOIN Weather W2
ON W1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(W2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE W1.temperature > W2.temperature;
```
3. use `datediff()` to find difference between two dates
```
--mysql
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
  AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```
4. use `to_date()` to convert string to date
```
SELECT TO_DATE('2020-05-26 13:27:18', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS');
```
5. change timezone (postgresql)
```
select created_at at time zone 'utc' at time zone 'pst'
from users;
```
### deal with multiple tables
1. `inner join`
```
-- join with more than one column
select *
from artists as a1
join albums as a2 
	on a1.CustomerId = a2.CustomerId
	and a1.Country = a2.Country 
```
2. use `where` as `join`
```
SELECT 
    artists.artistid, 
    artists.name AS artist_name, 
    albums.title AS album_name, 
    tracks.name AS song_name 
FROM artists, albums, tracks 
WHERE 
    artists.artistid = albums.artistid -- PK = FK 
    AND albums.albumid = tracks.albumid 
    AND artists.artistid IN (8, 100, 120)
    AND artists.name != "GGGG";
```
3. use `intercept` to select only rows which have the same values from two tables 
```
SELECT id FROM book_shop 
INTERSECT 
SELECT id FROM favourite_book;
```
4. use `except` to select only distinct values on left table
```
SELECT id FROM book_shop 
EXCEPT 
SELECT id FROM favourite_book;
```
5. use `union` to select all values from both tables but their schemas have to be equivalent 
```
--1 no include duplicate
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers

--2 include duplicate
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM Suppliers

--3 with using natural join (similar to inner join but not return the common column)
WITH 
TheMostActiveUser AS (
    SELECT user_id, name
    FROM 
        Users
        NATURAL JOIN MovieRating
    GROUP BY user_id, name
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, name
    LIMIT 1
),
TheBestMovieFebruary AS (
    SELECT movie_id, title
    FROM
        Movies
        NATURAL JOIN MovieRating
    WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) ='2020-02-01' 
    GROUP BY movie_id, title
    ORDER BY AVG(rating) DESC, title
    LIMIT 1
)

SELECT name AS results
FROM TheMostActiveUser
UNION ALL
SELECT title as results
FROM TheBestMovieFebruary
```
### about condition
1.  `case when` condition
```
SELECT
    Company,
    CASE
        WHEN Company is not NULL then &quot;Corporate&quot;
        ELSE &quot;End Customer&quot;
    END as segment
FROM customers;
```
2. `coalesce(targeted column, value to replace null)` 
* it can be replaced in some sql databases which have `ifnull`
```
SELECT DISTINCT
   product_name,
   description,
   COALESCE(
      CASE WHEN 
         LENGTH(description) >= 60 
         THEN NULL 
         ELSE description 
         END, 
      product_name) product_name_or_description
FROM products
```
### window function
1. `ntile()` to rows to 4 groups based on specific column
```
select 
    segment, 
    count(*), 
    avg(Milliseconds) from(
	    select 
	        title as albumName,
	        name as trackName, 
	        Milliseconds, 
	        ntile(4) over(order by Milliseconds desc) as segment 
	from albums
	join tracks using(AlbumId)
)
group by segment;
```
2. `rank()` to sort rows by column and assign a rank but if find tie, will skip to the next rank like `1 2 2 4`  
```
select * from (
	select 
	    title as albumName,
	    name as trackName, 
	    Milliseconds, 
	    rank() over(PARTITION by title order by Milliseconds) as rankNum
	from albums
	join tracks using(AlbumId)
)
where rankNum = 1;
```
* `dense_rank()`: like `rank()` but not skip rank `1 2 2 3`
* `row_number()`: assigns a sequential integer number to each row in the queryâ€™s result set, so the number won't be the same
use `window function` when a calculation is needed to be performed on a set of rows(defined by partition columns) and still keep the result at row level. If we use group by we would have to use aggregation functions on any columns that are not part of the group by clause.
